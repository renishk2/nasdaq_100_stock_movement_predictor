    "### Background Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that `61%` of U.S. adults own stocks? The lowest this percentage has hit was in `2013` and `2016` when only `52%` of adults owned stocks. For over a decade now, more than 50% of the adult population in the U.S. are regularly investing in the stock market. Investing has always been a passion, while for others it has now become a hobby and a way to make money. One would mainly invest for a short-term while the other would prefer investing for a long-term. The only difference is that people that invest for short-term are regularly buying/selling. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you think about buying and selling there are so many factors involved that could potentially lead to a profit or a loss per trade. The stock market is very volatile, prices increase/decrease in no time. Due to this volatility one carefully invests in stocks that are guaranteed to result some fruit. A lot of research goes into the particular stock before it is bought or sold by individuals. There are various technologies in the world that help individuals build a portfolio based on the risk level they set. This is then managed by the company you signed up with. One would only get access to the dashboard where they are able to see their returns. But what if we could find a way where individuals can grow their portfolio by creating a technology that could help them determine the stock movement and based on that invest at the right time? "

    "\n",
    "To further carry this investigation and creating an ML model, we need a dataset. The dataset I chose to base my investgation on was the NASDAQ-100 stocks. The NASDAQ-100 index consists of the largest non-financial companies. Some of the very renowned companies are `Apple`, `Microsoft`, `Amazon`, `Google`, `Meta`, `Tesla` and many more. The index is ranked third on the list of stock exchanges by market capitalization, after the `S&P 500`  and the `Dow Jones Industrial Average` in the United States. The original source of the dataset is the `yahoo finance api`, which was then uploaded onto `Kaggle`. The data ranges from 2010 to 2021 and can be downloaded <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Re1QPoW2kPOm5hAK3lt8hU3-FoNOVl6-/view?usp=sharing'>here</a>."
