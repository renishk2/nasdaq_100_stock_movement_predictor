Implement the following accordingly 

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest

- Time Series Forecast (check out xgboost)

- Create a streamlit web app!

Looking at only top 10 Nasdaq 100 stocks 

- AAPL (Apple)
- MSFT (Microsoft)
- GOOG (Google Class C)
- GOOGL (Google Class A)
- AMZN (Amazon)
- TSLA (Tesla)
- META 
- NVDA (Nvidia)
- PEP (Pepsi)
- COST(Costco)



Data Cleaning: 

- Load Data
- Shape 
- Info 
- Describe 
- Null 
- Duplicates 


EDA: 
- Convert Date column to datatime
- Check the total number of datapoints for all individual stocks
- Split the dataframe into group of stocks such as 'tech stocks' and save as CSV
- Create a new column based on the closed column (shift) looking at prev close 
- Look at the total number of days 
- Distributions of all columns 
- Plot visuals based on the closing price and date 
- max and min value of the adj close


Modelling: 


Classification: 

- if the prev close > close then do 1 otherwise 0 

- we are predicting whether the stock is going up or down 

models to consider: 

logistic regression 

svm 

random forest 

------


Notes: 

- Fix the code commenting and markdowns for all books 
- Review the trading strategy part and explain how looking at diff between adj close from previous day and present day helps
