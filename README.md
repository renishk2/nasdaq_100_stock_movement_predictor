# NASDAQ-100 Stocks Movement Predictor

## Introduction: 

Did you know that `61%` of U.S. adults own stocks? The lowest this percentage has hit was in `2013` and `2016` when only `52%` of adults owned stocks. For over a decade now, more than 50% of the adult population in the U.S. are regularly investing in the stock market. Investing has always been a passion, while for others it has now become a hobby and a way to make money. One would mainly invest for a short-term while the other would prefer investing for a long-term. The only difference is that people that invest for short-term are regularly buying/selling. 

When you think about buying and selling there are so many factors involved that could potentially lead to a profit or a loss per trade. The stock market is very volatile, prices increase/decrease in no time. Due to this volatility one carefully invests in stocks that are guaranteed to result some fruit. A lot of research goes into the particular stock before it is bought or sold by individuals. There are various technologies in the world that help individuals build a portfolio based on the risk level they set. This is then managed by the company you signed up with. One would only get access to the dashboard where they are able to see their returns. But what if we could find a way where individuals can grow their portfolio by creating a technology that could help them determine the stock movement and based on that invest at the right time?

## Goal: 

To train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the stock price movement, in particular looking at the positive or negative movements. Based on this information we can then predict whether the stock price would be going up or down the next day.

## Navigating the project: 

The Notebooks folder contains 4 books: 
- Data Cleaning (Book 1) This contains the introduction and the initial cleaning of the dataset
- EDA - 1(Book 2) - This contains the Exploratory Data Analysis and leads to the first part of modelling. 
- EDA - 2 (Book 3) - This book is a continuation of the EDA after the logistic model from the modelling book. 
- Modelling (Book 4) - This contains all the ml models and have been evaluated.

## Next Steps:

In the current investigation we focused on classification and not regression when predicting stocks data. Therefore, for the next steps I would like to use regression models to predict the exact price of the stock. Getting a larger dataset with more values of each individual stock would really help narrow down on what stocks to buy/sell.
